### Guidelines
Use Transitions and Transforms of CSS3 to implement the tasks

## Tasks
* When the mouse enters a navigation link, the entire link part (the colored block) will slide right, crossing the navigation panel (the left part of the link part will still be colored)
* When the mouse enters the compose button, the icon will perform a full rotation
* When the mouse enters a message the following  will happen:
    * The entire message will pop out and grow a bit
    * The importance indicator will change its color to grey
* In addition, add more messages and now every odd item message will have a grey background instead of the previous color
